The market opportunity is substantial, with BWP 14.3 billion in informal economic activity currently operating outside the formal financial system. Our solution directly addresses the pain points of 200,000+ informal traders while creating multiple revenue streams that lead to strong financial returns for investors.

With the right partnerships, particularly FNB Botswana's backing, and proper execution of our three-phase implementation strategy, FNB Be can become the dominant fintech platform in Botswana and a model for similar initiatives across Southern Africa.
